# ShengBot
Private Discord bot so that I can practice JavaScript! :D  

Code template from https://discordjs.guide/  

## Current Commands

starboard: Manage a starboard in a server. Starred messages that meet the minimum number of stars are sent to the output channel.  
This is functional, but needs to be tested for bugs regarding message formats, attachments, links, etc. Better error handling will be added, so that the bot crashes less.
